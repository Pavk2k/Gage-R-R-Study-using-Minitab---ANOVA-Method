# Gage R&R Study - ANOVA Method (Minitab)

This project showcases a Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gage R&R) study conducted using the **ANOVA method** via Minitab software. It includes the raw data (Excel format) and visual/statistical analysis outputs from Minitab.

## üî¨ Key Insights

### ANOVA Table
- **Parts**, **Operators**, and **Part √ó Operator interaction** are all statistically significant (p-value < 0.05).
- Indicates differences in measurements are influenced by part variability and operator performance.

### Variance Components
- **Part-to-Part** variation dominates (97.02% of total variation).
- **Total Gage R&R** accounts for only **2.98%**, indicating the measurement system is acceptable.

### Gage Evaluation
- Study variation is **16.72%**, and %Tolerance (SV/Toler) is **167.21%**.
- The measurement system has decent resolution: **8 distinct categories**.

### Misclassification Probabilities
- Small chance (1.3%) that a good part is wrongly rejected.
- Slightly lower chance (0.9%) of a bad part being wrongly accepted.

## üìå Conclusion

This Gage R&R study confirms the measurement system is **acceptable** with low variation due to repeatability and reproducibility. Most variation is from the parts themselves, which is ideal.
